# realtime_sound_plotting
Bunch of scripts which visualise sound as it is recorded from the laptop microphones. 
All scripts are based on the [sounddevice](https://python-sounddevice.readthedocs.io/en/0.3.7/#callback-streams) library for sound acquisition.

The 'fast' visualisations requires [pyqtgraph](http://www.pyqtgraph.org/), and the 'slower' ones need an installation of matplotlib.
